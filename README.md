# Problem Solving
Problems solved using various solution techniques (iterative, recursive, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking, brand and bound).

## Fibonacci
  -  Notes:
      - F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
      - F(0) = 1, F(1) = 1
  - Solution:
      - Recursive.
      - Dynamic Programming:
        - Memoization.
        - Tabulation.

## Max Power
 - You have a grid (n x n) and each cell has a power value, and only can move to the right or the down cell from your current cell.
 - Your task is to find the max power value strating from top leftmost cell till ending at the bottom rightmost cell.
 - Solution:
   - Dynamic Programming:
        - Memoization.
