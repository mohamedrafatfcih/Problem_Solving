# Problem Solving
Problems solved using various solution techniques (iterative, recursive, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking, brand and bound).

## Fibonacci
  -  Notes:
      - F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
      - F(0) = 1, F(1) = 1
  - Solution:
      - Recursive
      - Dynamic Programming
        - Memoization
        - Tabulation
